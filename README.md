# Python Arcade Shooter Game
## Summary
This topic focuses on utilizing Python's Pygame library to design a classic aircraft shooting game. The objective is to provide players with an exhilarating air combat experience while enabling developers to learn the fundamental technologies and design processes involved in game development. The game design includes the player controlling an aircraft to move through keyboard operations, avoiding rocks and shooting rocks to gain points. The game implementation is divided into multiple functional modules: first, use Pygame's graphics function to design dynamic backgrounds, airplanes, stones and bullets, simulating real flight scenes; secondly, realize the movement control of the player's airplane, random generation and movement path of stones, As well as the collision judgment of the player's bullet firing mechanism and the rocks; in addition, combining the score system and the health value mechanism, the rocks collision penalties and destruction rewards are designed, and explosion special effects and sound effects are added to the game to enhance the immersion. This topic also includes dynamic adjustments to the game logic, which will increase the difficulty of the game over time, allowing players to continue to feel a sense of challenge and achievement. Through this topic, developers will fully master the core game development skills such as event driving, collision detection, and game logic design, and can further expand functions on this basis.

## About the future plans
Additional functions and special effects can be incorporated into the game to enhance the user experience (UX).
